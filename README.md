## <a name="building"></a> Building the code   
### <a name="install-dependencies"></a> Installing dependencies
It is assumed here that ROS is already installed on the system. In order to install *hector quadrotor* packages there are two ways and can be done as follows:

Installing from binary packages:
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-hector-*
```

Or one can build from the source:
```
$ mkdir ~/ros_ws
$ cd ~/ros_ws
$ wstool init src https://raw.github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor/hydro-devel/tutorials.rosinstall
$ catkin_make 
```

Then workspace needs to be source to use the project. 

To install another dependency *Octomap* following steps can be followed:
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-octomap
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-octomap-mapping 
$ rosdep install octomap_mapping 
$ rosmake octomap_mapping
```

The other two dependencies can be installed as follows. Navigate to the src of workspace:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap_rviz_plugins.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

And,
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-octovis
```

To use teleop package, install the following package as follows:
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-keyboard
```


>NOTE: Both, hector and octomap_mapping, the packages are notorious for not building properly in the first go. Please ensure that both the packages are installed properly before moving forward. 

### <a name="build-project"></a> Building the package
Once all the dependencies are fulfilled, the package can be built as follows. Navigate to the src folder of the workspace:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nr-parikh/voyager.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

## <a name="running"></a> Running the node 
To run the node please follow the instruction given in this section. Open a terminal and launch a file using given below:
```
$ roslaunch voyager world.launch
```

The command given above will start gazebo and rviz plugin and a custom world. It will also spawn the robot in that world. To start exploring and mapping the environment, launch the following file:
```
$ roslaunch voyager voyager.launch
```

As soon as this command is launched the robot will start exploring the world unless and until it is asked to stop. In order to stop the robot and land it at a safe place, one can use a service `/explore` as follows:
```
$ rosservice call /explore false
```

This command will stop the robot from exploring and land it safely on ground. However, it should be ensure that there is a safe place for the robot to land. To start exploring again, one can call the same service but now with `true` and not `false`. 

One can also create a new custom world and use that world in this package as well by launching the same file i.e. *world.launch* but with following argument:
```
$ roslaunch voyager world.launch world:=<path to world file>/<world file>
```

Instead of having the robot to explore on its own, one can manually operate the robot and explore as one wants. This can be done using teleop package after installing it as follows:
```
$ roslaunch voyager world.launch use_teleop:=true
```

#### Recording bag file 
The bag file can also be recorded using the following command using the same launch file:
```
$ roslaunch voyager world.launch record_bag:=true
```
This command will record the bag file for the duration of 30 seconds and store it in results directory. 
>NOTE: All the topics are being recorded except the camera topics since the size of the file was off the limit. 

### Saving the tree
The tree being generated can be save by running the following command:
```
$ rosrun octomap_server octopmap_saver -f <name of the file>
```

This will save the file at the location from where the command was executed. 

## <a name="testing"></a> Testing 
The unit tests for this package can be ran using the following commands. After cloning the repository, navigate to the root of the workspace and run the following command:
```
$ catkin_make run_tests 
```

Alternatively, the tests can also be run as follows:
```
$ rostest voyager test_voyager.launch
```

#### Viewing the generated tree 
To view a tree please install octovis as mentioned in the dependencies section. To view the file execute the following command:
```
$ octovis <path to file>
```

For example, a sample map given in the results section can be viewed as:
```
$ octovis <path to ws>/voyager/results/sample_output.ot
```

## <a name="output"></a> Sample output
Sample output generated by the package by exploring the a custom test worl looks as shown below:

## <a name="docs"></a> Documentation
The documentation for this project can be found at the path `docs/html/index.html`. The documentation for this project is created using doxygen-gui. To generate the documentation again, please execute the commands given below:
```
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen 
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
$ doxywizard
```

The last command opens up the GUI window of doxygen. First select a dummy folder for doxygen to run from. After that, complete the details as required like name, synopsis, and version of the project. Select this repository as source directory and select a destination directory as well. Please make sure you check scan recursively option in order to generate the complete documentation. Once doxygen runs successfully, navigate to your destination directory, go to html folder and open index.html file.

## <a name="sip"></a> Solo Iterative Process 
While developing this module SIP process was followed. The link to the SIP sheet for this module is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tZz-o4cJSky1bMGR0uIQGLcoGgMJUM74vtqE4XKSQ8/edit?usp=sharing). Please note that the legend for the code tags is mentioned in the sheet itself.

The spreadsheet contains product backlog which gives overview of how the project was executed. The second spreadsheet is Task backlog which gives details of how each of the task were executed and the time consumed. The thirs spreadsheet is Release backlog which shows the improvements in the estimation of the time required to complete certain task as the module is developed.
